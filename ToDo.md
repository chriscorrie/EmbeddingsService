# EmbeddingsService Performance Optimization - ToDo & Progress Tracker

### Immediate next steps to address
- The statistics for individual tasks do not appear to be update in the processing-status api call in real-time for documents, like they are for opportunities (documents processed, skipped, chunks generated, etc.).
- The statistics for entities_extracted also are not updated until processing is complete.
- The deduplication/consolidation logic for entities extracted by OpportunityId does not appear to be running either...we have lots of duplciate entities.

### **Standard Testing Parameters**
- **Test Range**: Rows 1-35 (mandatory for consistency)
- **Reprocess Flag**: `false` (don't reprocess existing records)
- **Service**: `document-embedding-api` (not document-embedding-api-v3)
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/embeddings/process-embeddings`
- **Status Check**: `GET /api/v1/status/processing-status/<task_id>`

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED OPTIMIZATIONS**

### **2. Async Entity Extraction (MAJOR WIN)**
- **Implementation**: `EntityExtractionQueue` with 2 dedicated worker threads
- **Architecture**: Completely decoupled from main processing pipeline
- **Performance Impact**: 18.2% improvement over original system
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and validated
- **Files Modified**: `scalable_processor.py`
- **Key Features**:
  - Non-blocking entity extraction
  - Queue-based task submission
  - Proper shutdown handling
  - Thread-safe statistics
  - Configurable via `ENABLE_ENTITY_EXTRACTION` flag

### **3. Chunk Embedding Cache Removal (PERFORMANCE)**
- **Rationale**: GPU embeddings are fast enough that cache overhead exceeds benefits
- **Removed**: All `ENABLE_CHUNK_EMBEDDING_CACHE` configuration and code
- **Impact**: Reduced memory usage, eliminated cache management overhead
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Files Modified**: `config.py`, `scalable_processor.py`, `production_rest_api_service.py`, debug files

## ‚ùå **ATTEMPTED OPTIMIZATIONS (DO NOT RETRY)**

### **1. Early Exit Boilerplate Detection**
- **Attempt**: Try to exit boilerplate detection early if no boilerplate found initially
- **Problem**: Boilerplate can appear anywhere in documents, not just at the beginning
- **Result**: Not feasible - must scan entire document
- **Lesson**: Complete document analysis is required for accurate boilerplate filtering

### **2. Chunk Embedding Caching**
- **Attempt**: Cache embeddings for duplicate/similar chunks to avoid recomputation
- **Problem**: 
  - Cache grows very large with minimal hit rate
  - GPU embeddings are so fast (5,269 sentences/second) that cache overhead exceeds benefits
  - Memory management complexity outweighs gains
- **Result**: Removed entirely
- **Lesson**: When hardware is fast enough, caching can hurt more than help

### **3. Parallel Entity Extraction**
- **Problem**: Dual entity extraction systems caused unexpected overhead
- **Issue**: Even when "disabled", legacy code paths were still executing
- **Result**: Complete removal required
- **Lesson**: Clean up old code paths completely rather than just disabling them

## üîÑ **NEXT OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES** (Priority Order)

### **3. GPU Acceleration Optimization (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- **Current Status**: Basic GPU detection and batch size scaling
- **Opportunities**:
  - Fine-tune GPU memory usage patterns
  - Optimize batch processing for specific GPU architecture
  - Dynamic batch size adjustment based on available VRAM
  - CUDA stream optimization for concurrent operations
- **Expected Impact**: 20-40% improvement on GPU-enabled systems
- **Prerequisites**: PyTorch + CUDA environment
- **Files to Investigate**: `scalable_processor.py` GPU detection and batching logic

  - Prepared statement optimization
  - Batch SQL operations
  - Connection reuse across requests
- **Expected Impact**: 10-15% improvement for high-concurrency scenarios
- **Files to Modify**: `scalable_processor.py` SQL connection setup

### **3. Embedding Model Warm-up & Preloading (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- **Current Status**: Model loaded on first request
- **Opportunities**:
  - Pre-warm embedding model during service startup
  - Model state caching between requests
  - Optimize model initialization time
- **Expected Impact**: 5-10% improvement on cold starts
- **Files to Investigate**: Service startup sequences

### **4. Memory Management Optimization (LOW PRIORITY)**
- **Current Status**: Basic memory monitoring
- **Opportunities**:
  - Dynamic batch size adjustment based on available memory
  - Memory pressure detection and response
  - Garbage collection optimization
  - Memory pooling for frequent allocations
- **Expected Impact**: Better resource utilization, fewer OOM errors

- **Prerequisites**: Milvus performance profiling

### **6. SQL Stored Procedure Optimization (FUTURE CONSIDERATION)**
- **Current Status**: Individual stored procedure calls per FileId
- **Optimization Trigger**: Only if large numbers of FileIds are returned from Milvus opportunity_documents searches
- **Proposed Solution**: Rewrite `FBOInternalAPI.GetEmbeddingFileOpportunities` to accept table-valued parameter with multiple FileIds in single call
- **Expected Impact**: Better scalability for high-volume FileId-to-OpportunityId mapping scenarios
- **Implementation**: Only pursue if performance issues emerge from current approach
